# POSSIBLE ERRORS
# 1. If you get a permissions error when trying to clone these submodules, you may not have your ssh keys set up correctly
# in github. We use ssh to clone the repos, not https.
#
# 2. If you get an error that some file in a repo was not found (such as autogen.sh in isl), you may have partially
# cloned a submodule before but not completed it, meaning some of the files are missing. Make sure to delete the .git
# folder in that submodule directory to force the clone to happen again.
