This notebook aims to test the k-best (k=5) prediction model for the Loop Interchange transformation. 
The targeted metric: search performance. 
The used method: simulation of Beam search on the benchmark.
This notebook can be used on multiple computations Tiramisu functions as well as single computation ones.
The current version uses the final model of the k-best model (k=5 with depth_max=7) (check k-best_model ).
