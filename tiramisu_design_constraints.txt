- To Consider:
    - Use the visitor pattern.

- We can't use ISL only to represent Tiramisu expressions, because the public
interface of ISL does allow the creation of isl_ast_expr nodes such as select,
if_then_else, ...
- We need an "operation" class, "computation" inherits from "operation",
- Test code has to be written in a tester class that can access private methods
of tested classes,
- Currently if a computation is scheduled to be executed using two separate
loops as in the following example
    for (i=0; i<10; i++)
	S0;
    for (i=10; i<N; i++)
	S0;
We do not have any way to say that we wantt o vectorize the first loop nest
without the second.
- Currently after transformation, the code may completely change (new loops
appear), we do not any way to expect or reference those loops.
