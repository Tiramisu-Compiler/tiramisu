      * Set the schedule indicated by \p map.
      *
      * \p map is a string that represents a mapping from the iteration domain
      * to the time-space domain (the ISL format to represent maps is
      * documented in http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/barvinok.pdf in Sec 1.2.2).
      *
      * The schedule is a map from the iteration domain to a time space
      * domain. The same name of space should be used for both the range
      * and the domain of the schedule.
      *
      * In general, users can set the schedule using high level functions such
      * as before(), after(), tile(), compute_at(), vectorize(), split(), ...
      * The use of this function is only reserved for advanced users who want
      * a low level control of the schedule.
      *
      * Vectors in the time-space domain have the following form
      *
      * computation_name[redundancy_ID,static,dynamic,static,dynamic,static,dynamic,static,...]
      *
      * The first dimension of the vector is used to indicate the redundancy ID
      * (the notion of the redundancy ID is explained later).
      *
      * The following dimensions are interleaved dimensions: static, dynamic, static,
      * dynamic, ...
      * Dynamic dimensions represent the loop levels, while static dimensions are
      * used to order statements within a given block of statements in a given loop
      * level.
      * For example, the computations c0 and c1 in the following loop nest
      *
      * for (i=0; i<N: i++)
      *   for (j=0; j<N; j++)
      *   {
      *     c0;
      *     c1;
      *   }
      *
      * have the following representations in the iteration domain
      *
      * {c0[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      * {c1[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      *
      * and the following representation in the time-space domain
      *
      * {c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      * {c1[0,0,i,0,j,1]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      *
      * The first dimension (dimension 0) in the time-space
      * domain (the leftmost dimension) is the redundancy ID
      * (in this case it is 0, the meaning of this ID will be explained later).
      * The second dimension (starting from the left) is a static dimension,
      * the third dimension is a dynamic dimension that
      * represents the loop level i, ..., the fifth dimension is a dynamic
      * dimension that represents the loop level j and the last dimension
      * (dimension 5) is a static dimension and allows the ordering of
      * c1 after c0 in the loop nest.
      *
      * To transform the previous iteration domain to the
      * time-space domain, the following schedule should be used:
      *
      * {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      * {c1[i,j]->c1[0,0,i,0,j,1]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      *
      * The first dimension called "redundancy ID" is only meaningful if the
      * computation is redundant. i.e., some parts of the computation are
      * redundantly computed.  Redundant computations are in general used to
      * maximize parallelism and data locality on the expense of doing some
      * computations redundantly.
      * For example, if the two computations c1(i,j) and c2(i,j) both depend
      * on the computation c0(i,j), instead of waiting for c0(i,j) to be
      * computed and then computing c1(i,j) and c2(i,j) in parallel, the thread
      * executing c1(i,j) can compute c0(i,j) by itself and then run c1(i,j).
      * The thread that computes c2(i,j) can do the same and compute c0(i,j)
      * by itself and then compute c2(i,j). In this case the two threads do not
      * need to wait. This is done at the expense of redundant computation since
      * c0(i,j) is computed by both threads.
      *
      * In general redundant computations are useful when tiling stencil
      * computations.  In the context of stencils such a tiling is called
      * "overlapped tiling".  Tiles that depend on results computed by other
      * tiles that run in parallel can compute the boundaries redundantly which
      * allows them to avoid waiting and thus can run in parallel.
      *
      * In Tiramisu, the user can indicate that a chunk of a computation
      * should be computed redundantly. The original computation always has a redundancy
      * ID equal to 0 (which means this is the original computation).
      * The redundant chunk has an ID that is different from 0 and that is
      * used to uniquely identify it.
      *
      * For example if we want to compute all of c0 three times (that is,
      * compute the original computation and compute two redundant computations),
      * we can use the following schedules:
      *
      * The schedule of the original computation:      {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      * The schedule of the redundant computation N°1: {c0[i,j]->c0[1,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      * The schedule of the redundant computation N°2: {c0[i,j]->c0[2,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      *
      * The schedule of c0 in this case would be three maps that map c0[i,j] to
      * the three different redundant computations in the time-processor domain:
      *
      * {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N;
      *  c0[i,j]->c0[1,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N;
      *  c0[i,j]->c0[2,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
      *
      * The function set_schedule() overrides any other schedule set by the high level
      * scheduling functions.  Currently the user has to choose between using the high
      * level scheduling functions or using this low level set_schedule function. The user
      * cannot mix the use of the two in the same program because they are not compatible.

      * \p iteration_domain_str is a string that represents the iteration
      * domain of the computation.  The iteration domain should be written
      * in the ISL format (http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/barvinok.pdf Section 1.2.1).
      *
      * The iteration domain of a statement is a set that contains
      * all of the execution instances of the statement (a statement in a
      * loop has an execution instance for each loop iteration in which
      * it executes). Each execution instance of a statement in a loop
      * nest is uniquely represented by an identifier and a tuple of
      * integers  (typically,  the  values  of  the  outer  loop  iterators).
      *
      * For example, the iteration space of the statement S0 in the following
      * loop nest
      * for (i=0; i<2; i++)
      *   for (j=0; j<3; j++)
      *      S0;
      *
      * is {S0(0,0), S0(0,1), S0(0,2), S0(1,0), S0(1,1), S0(1,2)}
      *
      * S0(0,0) is the execution instance of S0 in the iteration (0,0).
      *
      * The previous set of integer tuples can be compactly described
      * by affine constraints as follows
      *
      * {S0(i,j): 0<=i<2 and 0<=j<3}
      *
      * In general, the loop nest
      *
      * for (i=0; i<N; i++)
      *   for (j=0; j<M; j++)
      *      S0;
      *
      * has the following iteration domain
      *
      * {S0(i,j): 0<=i<N and 0<=j<M}
      *
      * This should be read as: the set of points (i,j) such that
      * 0<=i<N and 0<=j<M.
      *
      * The name of the computation in the iteration domain should not
      * start with _ (an underscore).  Names starting with _ are reserved
      * names.
      *
      * \p e is the expression computed by the computation.
      * It is possible to declare the computation without specifying the expression.
      * The expression can be specified later using computation::set_expression().
      * An example of setting the expression after declaring the computation
      * is presented in tests/test_04.cpp.
      *
      * \p schedule_this_computation should be set to true if the computation
      * is supposed to be schedule and code is supposed to be generated from
      * the computation.  Set it to false if you just want to use the
      * computation to represent a buffer (that is passed as an argument
      * to the function) and you do not intend to generate code for the
      * computation.
      * An example where this argument is set to false is presented in
      * tests/test_14.cpp.
      *
      * \p t is the type of the computation, i.e. the type of the expression
      * computed by the computation. Example of types include (p_uint8,
      * p_uint16, p_uint32, ...).
      *
      * \p fct is a pointer to the Tiramisu function where this computation
      * should be added.
      *
      * Bound Inference:
      * The user can declare computations without providing any constraint
      * about the iteration domain, in this case he can rely on bound inference
      * to infer the constraints about each iteration domain. The user needs only
      * to provide constraints over the domains of the last computations (last
      * consumers), and Tiramisu will propagate these constraints to all the
      * chain of computations that precede those consumers.
      * Note that bound inference is not possible if you have multiple definitions
      * of the same computation. In such a case, you should provide constraints
      * over the iteration domain when you declare the computation.
      *

       * The schedule is a map from the iteration domain to a time space
       * domain. The same name of space should be used for both the range
       * and the domain of the schedule.
       *
       * In general, users can set the schedule using high level functions such
       * as before(), after(), tile(), compute_at(), vectorize(), split(), ...
       * The use of this function is only reserved for advanced users who want
       * a low level control of the schedule.
       *
       * Vectors in the time-space domain have the following form
       *
       * computation_name[redundancy_ID,static,dynamic,static,dynamic,static,dynamic,static,...]
       *
       * The first dimension of the vector is used to indicate the redundancy ID
       * (the notion of the redundancy ID is explained later).
       *
       * The following dimensions are interleaved dimensions: static, dynamic, static,
       * dynamic, ...
       * Dynamic dimensions represent the loop levels, while static dimensions are
       * used to order statements within a given block of statements in a given loop
       * level.
       * For example, the computations c0 and c1 in the following loop nest
       *
       * for (i=0; i<N: i++)
       *   for (j=0; j<N; j++)
       *   {
       *     c0;
       *     c1;
       *   }
       *
       * have the following representations in the iteration domain
       *
       * {c0[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       * {c1[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       *
       * and the following representation in the time-space domain
       *
       * {c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       * {c1[0,0,i,0,j,1]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       *
       * The first dimension (dimension 0) in the time-space
       * domain (the leftmost dimension) is the redundancy ID
       * (in this case it is 0, the meaning of this ID will be explained later).
       * The second dimension (starting from the left) is a static dimension,
       * the third dimension is a dynamic dimension that
       * represents the loop level i, ..., the fifth dimension is a dynamic
       * dimension that represents the loop level j and the last dimension
       * (dimension 5) is a static dimension and allows the ordering of
       * c1 after c0 in the loop nest.
       *
       * To transform the previous iteration domain to the
       * time-space domain, the following schedule should be used:
       *
       * {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       * {c1[i,j]->c1[0,0,i,0,j,1]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       *
       * The first dimension called "redundancy ID" is only meaningful if the
       * computation is redundant. i.e., some parts of the computation are
       * redundantly computed.  Redundant computations are in general used to
       * maximize parallelism and data locality on the expense of doing some
       * computations redundantly.
       * For example, if the two computations c1(i,j) and c2(i,j) both depend
       * on the computation c0(i,j), instead of waiting for c0(i,j) to be
       * computed and then computing c1(i,j) and c2(i,j) in parallel, the thread
       * executing c1(i,j) can compute c0(i,j) by itself and then run c1(i,j).
       * The thread that computes c2(i,j) can do the same and compute c0(i,j)
       * by itself and then compute c2(i,j). In this case the two threads do not
       * need to wait. This is done at the expense of redundant computation since
       * c0(i,j) is computed by both threads.
       *
       * In general redundant computations are useful when tiling stencil
       * computations.  In the context of stencils such a tiling is called
       * "overlapped tiling".  Tiles that depend on results computed by other
       * tiles that run in parallel can compute the boundaries redundantly which
       * allows them to avoid waiting and thus can run in parallel.
       *
       * In Tiramisu, the user can indicate that a chunk of a computation
       * should be computed redundantly. The original computation always has a redundancy
       * ID equal to 0 (which means this is the original computation).
       * The redundant chunk has an ID that is different from 0 and that is
       * used to uniquely identify it.
       *
       * For example if we want to compute all of c0 three times (that is,
       * compute the original computation and compute two redundant computations),
       * we can use the following schedules:
       *
       * The schedule of the original computation:      {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       * The schedule of the redundant computation N°1: {c0[i,j]->c0[1,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       * The schedule of the redundant computation N°2: {c0[i,j]->c0[2,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       *
       * The schedule of c0 in this case would be three maps that map c0[i,j] to
       * the three different redundant computations in the time-processor domain:
       *
       * {c0[i,j]->c0[0,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N;
       *  c0[i,j]->c0[1,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N;
       *  c0[i,j]->c0[2,0,i,0,j,0]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}
       *
       * The function set_schedule() overrides any other schedule set by the high level
       * scheduling functions.  Currently the user has to choose between using the high
       * level scheduling functions or using this low level set_schedule function. The user

      * root_dimension is a number used to specify the dimension level

      * The root dimension level is the outermost level.  It is the level

      * (outermost loop), loop 1 is the level of following inner loop, ...
      *
      * Where is this number used ?
      *
      * These numbers are used in the helper functions used for scheduling
      * (such as after(), before(), ...).
      * For example, c0.after(c1) indicates that the computation c0 should
      * be executed after the computation c1.
      * Since the two computations c0 and c1 are usually nested in a loop,
      * we need to specify at which loop level c0 is after c1. This is where
      * we need to specify the loop level numbers.
      * Here is an example.  Suppose that the two computations c0 and c1
      * have the following iteration domains
      * {c0[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N} and {c1[i,j]: 0<=i<N and 0<=j<N}.
      *
      * When code is generated for the two computations, two loop nests
      * are generated.  When scheduling c0 after c1 using the after function,
      * the user can choose one among three possibilities in specifying at
      * which level c0 is after c1.
      *
      * - c0.after(c1, computation::root_dimension) would create a schedule
      * that generates the following code
      *
      * for (i=0; i<N; i++)
      *     for (j=0; j<N; j++)

      *
      * - c0.after(c1, 0) would create a schedule that generates the
      * following code

      * for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
      *     for (j=0; j<N; j++)

      *     for (j=0; j<N; j++)
      *         c0;
